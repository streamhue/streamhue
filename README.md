Streamhue allows livestreamers on channels such as Twitch, YouTube and others, to have interactions with their smartlight systems, to react to donations, subscriptions amongst many other events.\
The project is currently heavily under development and should not be considered usable in any way, shape or form.

**NOTE**: Vue 3 (*and its ecosystem*) is still under development, and while we have a major release 3.0 out *(and use it in Streamhue)*, tooling is not complete, so expect **all** frontend packages, and the way you use them, to change. *(ui, web, common➜ components)*

## ✨ Getting started
`$ npm run bootstrap` to install and bootstrap. No need to `npm i`. 🥳

### VS Code
It is highly recommended you use VS Code and the supplied  workspace file (`streamhue.code-workspace`), together with the *highly* suggested extensions in [our extension pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streamhue.extensions), for the best possible development experience. (*This extension pack is subject to change, check back to see if there's any new recommendations*)

## 💻 Commands
`$ npm run reset` to wipe `node_modules` and reinstall everything.

`$ git cz` to make a commit. This will hold your hand. 🤝
